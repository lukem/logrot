.SH DESCRIPTION
.I logrot
rotates the log file
.I file, creating a new log file with the same permissions
as the original.
If necessary, the rotated file can be optionally filtered via
.IR "filter" ,
compressed with
.IR "compressor" ,
and post-processed with
.IR "postfilter" .
.PP
.I logrot
attempts to rotate the file as atomically as possible, in that the
time window in which
.I file
doesn't exist is minimised.
.PP
A signal
.I sig
can be sent to a process id stored in
.IR "pidfile" ,
and a time delay of
.I wait
seconds will occur before performing any filtering.
.PP
The name of the rotate file can be configured by specifying
the format string
.IR "rotatefmt" ,
and the target directory is
given in
.IR "destdir" .
.SH OPTIONS
.I logrot
accepts the following options (in the following list,
.I rotfile
is the name of the rotated file):
.TP 8
.B \-c
Compress data before storing in
.I rotfile.
.TP
.BI \-C " compressor"
Use
.I compressor
as the compression program for
.BR "\-c" .
Defaults to
.IR "gzip" (1).
.TP
.BI \-d " destdir"
Store
.I rotfile
in
.IR "destdir" .
Defaults to \`\fIfile\fR.d\'.
.TP
.BI \-f " filter"
Filter
.I file
through
.I filter
before optional compression and output to
.IR "rotfile" .
.TP
.BI \-F " postfilter"
Postprocess
.I rotfile
with
.IR "postfilter" .
The
.B "%"
character allows for escape sequences, a la
.IR "printf" (3).
The following escape sequences are supported:
.B "%%"
\`%%\' - a \`%\' sign.
\`%d\' \-
.IR "dirname" (1)
of
.IR "rotfile" .
\`%f\' \-
.IR "basename" (1)
of
.IR "rotfile" .
\`%p\' \-
full pathname of
.IR "rotfile" .
.TP
.BI \-p " pidfile"
Contains the pid of the process to signal with
.BI \-s " sig"
when the rotation has occurred.
The first word on the first line of
.I pidfile
is assumed to be the pid.
.TP
.BI \-r " rotatefmt"
Format of rotated filename, which is relative to 
.BI \-d " destdir".
Escape characters a la
.IR "printf" (3)
are available; refer to
.B "ROTATE FORMAT ESCAPE SEQUENCES"
below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-s " sig"
The signal to send to the process defined in
.BI \-p " pidfile"
after
.BI \-w " wait"
seconds have expired.
.TP
.BI \-w " wait"
Seconds to wait before sending the 
.BI \-s " sig"
signal.
.TP
.BI \-X " compressext"
Extension to append to
.I rotfile
if compression occurred.
Defaults to \`.gz\'.
.SS ROTATE FORMAT ESCAPE SEQUENCES
The
.I rotatefmt
specified in 
.BI \-r " rotatefmt"
can have escape sequences with
.B "%"
a la
.IR "printf" (3).
All of the date/time escapes are generated with the same named sequence from
.IR "strftime" (3).
.PP
The following escape sequences are available:
.TP 6
.B %%
A \`%\' sign.
.TP
.B %f
The
.IR "basename" (1)
of
.IR "file" .
.TP
.B %y
Current year within century (e.g, 97).
.TP
.B %Y
Current year, including century (e.g, 1997)
.TP
.B %m
Current month, with leading 0 if necessary (e.g., 02)
.TP
.B %d
Current day, with leading 0 if necessary (e.g., 27)
.TP
.B %H
Current hour (24-hour clock), with leading 0 if necessary (e.g., 23)
.TP
.B %M
Current minute, with leading 0 if necessary (e.g., 09)
.TP
.B %S
Current second, with leading 0 if necessary (e.g., 42)
.SH DIAGNOSITICS
.I logrot
will exit with a value of 1 upon any error.
.PP
If the error occurred after the rotation occurred but before the
filtering completed successfully, then a temporary file of the
form \`\fIfile\fR.logrot.XXXXXX\' (where \`XXXXXX\' is replaced
with a random number) will remain in the filesystem.
This is not removed to allow manual rotation to occur.
