* provide maintenance scripts to cull old rotated logfiles (it's
  better as a separate tool that's called as a postprocessor)

possible enhancements:
* create target directory if necessary
* support '%f' (and maybe others) in '-d destdir'
* warn if original log doesn't exist or is empty
* add "-S nn[bBkKMmGg]" - only rotate if size of log is >= nn[{suffix}]
* add "-T trigger" - only rotate if trigger returns 0
